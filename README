== ABOUT ==

  Hardbound is a fabulously simple static web site generator written in the most
accessible language there is: shell script. Essentially, all that Hardbound
does is convert a set of templates and plain text articles into a functional
website.

  Hardbound was inspired by these fantastic projects:
    Werc   http://werc.cat-v.org
    Jekyll http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
    
== USING ==

  To use Hardbound, you must first create a directory where all of the files
will be kept. Inside that directory, Hardbound expects there to be a `posts'
directory containing plain text articles, with the filenames in the format of:

  YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.markdown
  
  Hardbound will then convert each of those files to HTML, while maintaining a
a file that contains the title, filename, and href link value of each post. The
indexed file is used by template files to build the HTML post index.
