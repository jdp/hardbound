== ABOUT ==

  Hardbound is a fabulously simple static web site generator written in the most
accessible language there is: shell script. Essentially, all that Hardbound
does is convert a set of templates and plain text articles into a functional
website.

  Hardbound was inspired by these fantastic projects:
    Werc   http://werc.cat-v.org
    Jekyll http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
    
== USING ==
 
  To use Hardbound, you must first create a directory where all of the files
will be kept. Inside that directory, Hardbound expects there to be a `_posts'
directory containing plain text articles, with the filenames in the format of:

  YYYY-MM-DD-post-name.markdown
  
  Hardbound will then convert each of those files to HTML, using the `post.tpl'
file in the input directory's root. It will then put the HTML versions of those
files in the `posts' directory of the output directory. Finally, Hardbound will 
then build an `index.html' from the `index.tpl' file.

== TEMPLATES ==

  Hardbound uses Werc's template system, it's simple and easy to use. The
template system allows you to execute shell commands and gives you access to
environment variables. A quick overview:

  Lines prefixed with % will be executed as shell script.
  
    % echo "From shell"

  Multiline code goes between %{ and %}.
  
    %{
    for i in a b c; do
      echo <li>$i</li>
    done
    %}
    
  For inline environment variables, use %( and %).
  
    <div>The value of $PWD: %($PWD%)</div>

  Some special variables for Hardbound are:
  
    $postTitle  The title of the post. Available in `post.tpl'
    $postDate   The date of the post. Available in `post.tpl'
    $postBody   The body of the post. Available in `post.tpl'
    $postIndex  List of posts in <li> tags. Available in `index.tpl'
